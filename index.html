            <h1>Disclaimer & Information Statement</h1>

            <p>This website serves as a record of past events related to academic integrity and professional conduct within academic institutions. It contains internal group communications, including Slack messages, emails, WeChat conversations, and lab policies. The purpose is to present factual information and promote discussions on ethical standards in academia.</p>

            <p>This website provides factual records of events that occurred <strong>on or before 2023</strong>. The content reflects past incidents based on available communications and documented materials. <strong>It does not represent any current situation.</strong> For up-to-date information, please consult current or former students.</p>

            <p>Some materials have been shared with <strong>the University of California, Irvine (UCI)</strong> and several academic conferences. UCI conducted an independent investigation under the UC Abusive Conduct Policy following a formal complaint. The investigation <strong>substantiated violations of the policy</strong>, and the findings were provided to the leadership of the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences for appropriate administrative action. Due to university confidentiality policies, specific details of the violations and any actions taken have not been disclosed.</p>

            <p>USENIX reviewed concerns related to confidentiality in the peer review process. They acknowledged that certain actions <strong>violated program committee confidentiality agreements</strong>, such as sharing submission PDFs and leaking review content. However, they determined that there was no direct harm evidence warranting formal sanctions. USENIX also clarified that it does not conduct broad investigations into individuals but remains open to providing information if requested by relevant bodies.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this website is to document historical events and promote discussions on academic integrity. <strong>No new accusations are made beyond what has already been acknowledged by institutions.</strong></p>

            <p>By continuing to browse this site, you acknowledge that the content is historical in nature and does not imply any present claims or accusations.</p>

            <!-- Student Reviews and Recognition -->
            <h2>Student Reviews and Recognition</h2>
            <p>Professor Qi Alfred Chen leveraged student labor for paper reviews, yet he only started to publicly acknowledge their contributions when he was reported in 2024. An email from a student confirmed writing 62 paper reviews between February 2, 2021, and October 20, 2023. However, Alfred stated that fulfilling these tasks was merely a part of their PhD training and did not warrant external recognition.</p>

            <p>Despite students performing extensive review work, Alfred took sole credit for the recognition. The lack of acknowledgment raises concerns about the fairness and ethics of how student contributions were utilized in the academic review process.</p>

            <!-- Experiment Documentation -->
            <h2>Experiment Documentation</h2>
            <p>This video documents an experiment where a student was instructed to use their own car for a crash test on an open road. The vehicle, running a maliciously modified autonomous driving software, was deliberately crashed into boxes. This raises significant concerns regarding research ethics, safety, and the exploitation of students for high-risk experiments.</p>
